# 🚀 Minimum Jumps to Reach the End | FAANG-Level Interview Problem
Welcome to the repository for my YouTube tutorial on solving the Minimum Jumps to Reach the End problem—one of the most frequently asked questions in FAANG/MAANG-level interviews!

## 🔑 About the Problem
The challenge is simple yet tricky:

Input: An array of positive integers where each element represents the maximum number of steps you can jump forward.
Goal: Determine the minimum number of jumps needed to reach the end of the array, starting from the first index.
Constraints: Ensure your solution is optimal with O(n) time complexity.

## 📺 Watch the Video Explanation
I’ve created a detailed tutorial explaining:

1. The greedy algorithm approach to solve the problem.
2. Why this problem is a favorite in top tech company interviews.
3. How to handle tricky edge cases like arrays with 0s.

## 🛠️ Key Highlights of the Solution
Greedy Strategy: At each step, calculate the farthest index you can reach and minimize jumps.
Edge Case Handling: Arrays with single elements, all zeros, or unreachable indices.
Optimal Complexity: Solution runs in O(n) time, making it scalable and efficient.

## 💡 Why Is This Problem Important?
Tests Problem-Solving Skills: Optimize your solution instead of brute-forcing it.
Focuses on Edge Cases: Demonstrates your ability to handle tricky scenarios.
Real-World Application: Solutions like this can be applied to pathfinding problems in graphs, games, and more.

## ✨ Pro Tips for Interview Prep
Understand the Greedy Approach: Explain why this is the best fit for the problem.
Handle Edge Cases Like a Pro: Think about cases like [0], [1, 0, 0], or [2, 3, 1, 1, 4].
Explain as You Code: In an interview, walk through your thought process clearly and logically.
